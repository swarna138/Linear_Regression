## General Information

Building a model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used  to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

## Conclusions
- Fall season seems to have attracted more booking.Booking count has increased drastically from 2018 to 2019.
- Most of the bookings has been done from may to oct.Trend increased starting of the year till mid of the year and then it started decreasing as we approached the end of year.
- Clear weather attracted more booking which makes sense. And in comparison to previous year, i.e 2018, booking increased for each weather situation in 2019.
- Thu, Fri, Sat have more number of bookings as compared to the start of the week.
- Test dataset R^2           : 0.7742
-   Test dataset Adjusted R^2  : 0.7623

- Demand of bikes depend on year, holiday, temp, windspeed, sep, Light_snowrain, Misty, spring, summer and winter.
